Rails.application.configure do
  #
  # Stenotype allows you to emit events which are then being published to a list of
  # targets. Currently two targets are provided by default: Google Cloud Pub Sub and
  # STDOUT for debug purposes.
  #
  # There is also a rails integration module which defines a handy DSL
  # for triggering events in various Rails components. ActionController and
  # ActiveJob are supported at the time of writing.
  #
  # Both extensions for Rails are enabled by default, but there are config options
  # to control their presence.
  # config.stenotype.rails do |rails_modules|
  #   rails_modules.enable_action_controller_ext = true
  #   rails_modules.enable_active_job_ext = true
  # end
  #
  #
  # To make publishing possible one must specify a list of targets. You could use
  # StdoutAdapter for debug purposes before switching to a production publisher.
  # By default the list of targets is empty and you'll get an error saying
  # that no targets are specified.
  #
  # A config option is available for setting up the targets:
  #
  # config.stenotype.targets = [Stenotype::Adapters::StdoutAdapter.new]
  #
  # Or using Google Cloud:
  #
  # config.stenotype.targets = [Stenotype::Adapters::GoogleCloud.new]
  #
  # Or both:
  #
  # config.stenotype.targets = [
  #   Stenotype::Adapters::StdoutAdapter.new,
  #   Stenotype::Adapters::GoogleCloud.new
  # ]
  #
  # To be able to use Google Cloud one has to specify Google Cloud credentials:
  #
  # config.stenotype.google_cloud do |gc_config|
  #   gc_config.credentials = "SPECIFY YOUR CREDENTIALS" # path/to/key.json
  #   gc_config.project_id = "SPECIFY YOUR PROJECT ID"
  #   gc_config.topic = "SPECIFY YOUR TOPIC"
  #   gc_config.mode = :async
  # end
  #
  # Each event is shipped with a UUID generated with SecureRandom by default.
  # This might be changed by using a corresponding config option. Note that
  # uuid_generator expects method #uuid to be implemented
  #
  # config.stenotype.uuid_generator = SecureRandom
  #
  # In rare cases you might want to get control over how the event is being dispatched.
  # Dispatcher must implement instance method #publish.
  # Which dispatcher to use is controlled by the following config option:
  #
  # config.stenotype.dispatcher = Stenotype::Dispatcher
  #
